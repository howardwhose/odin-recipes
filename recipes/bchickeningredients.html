    <p><h2>Ingredients & Substitutes</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> I love starting with good quality fresh ripe & pulpy/meaty tomatoes that are naturally sweet and slightly tart. But you may use canned versions without added citric acid. Choose between – 1 cup (8 oz) passata / canned tomato puree or ⅓ cup double concentrate tomato paste or 1 – 14 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes. Towards the end if you feel you need more intense tomatoey flavor, feel free to stir in a bit of tomato paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Greek yogurt/ Hung curd:</strong> Marinade requires thick strained yogurt like this Hung curd or Greek yogurt. Using regular yogurt (with whey) will easily let out too much moisture while roasting the chicken & all the spice marinade goes over to the pan. This makes your chicken taste bland. If your yogurt is runny, you may strain it following this Hung curd recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices: </strong>To make a good butter chicken you need a really good garam masala else your dish can end up being bland without any flavors. You can make your own from this Garam masala recipe or use store bought. But be sure to use an aromatic blend and adjust the quantity because every brand is different.</li>
        <li><strong>Kashmiri Red chili:</strong> this powder is pure Indian chili powder (ground dried red chilies). It is a medium hot chili powder which also imparts brighter color to your dish. You may substitute it with Byadgi chili powder or a mix of smoked paprika & cayenne pepper (1:1).</li>
        <li><strong>Coriander and cumin powder</strong>: These add mild flavors to your dish, tone down the strong flavors of the garam masala and helps balance the tartness of the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Kasuri methi:</strong> this is dried fenugreek leaves and it is the key ingredient used in this dish. There is no substitute for this and you may leave out if you don’t have but you will surely miss those magical flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Cashews:</strong> Cashews impart a delicate flavor & acts as a thickener. It gives a smooth and silky richness to the sauce. You can use almonds or almond flour as a substitute but the flavors are different. To use almonds, soak them in hot water for 2 hours, peel and grind to a smooth paste/ puree. If using almond flour, grind it with water to a smooth paste. To make the dish nut-free, substitute cashews with ¼ to ⅓ cup heavy cream and cut down the amount of water to 1 cup.</li>
