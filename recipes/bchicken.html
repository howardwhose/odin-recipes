   <h1 align="center">This is the best butter chicken recipe and how to make it.</h1>
   <p>YES it is! It’s called Murgh Makhani and it hails from Northern India. It’s quite a mild curry compared to many Indian curries, and outside of India, it’s become just about everybody’s favourite curry!</p>

    And if you’ve never tried a homemade one before, that needs to change!, with a bit more patience, the time is totally worth it. This is a fabulous curry that the whole family will love.
