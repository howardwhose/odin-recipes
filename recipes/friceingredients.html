    <p><h2>Ingredients & Substitutes</h2></p>
    <p>The ingredients for the fried rice can be anything that is left over in the fridge. Basically you will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>   
        <li>1/2 onion , finely chopped</li>        
        <li>2 garlic cloves , minced</li>        
        <li>80g bacon , chopped (optional, or use ham)</li>
        <li>8-10 frozen prawns, thawed and marinated in soy for ten minutes</li>
        <li>150g chicken diced and marinated in soy for ten minutes</li>
        <li>1 – 1 1/2 cups diced vegetables , frozen or fresh</li>
        <li>2 cups (packed) cooked day old white rice</li>
        <li>3 eggs, whisked</li>
        <li>3/4 cup green onions , (shallots / scallions) sliced</li> 
        <li>1 tbsp Chinese cooking wine (sub Mirin, cooking sake or dry sherry)</li>
        <li>fish sauce - a splah or two added to the riced as cooking</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Oyster Sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil </li>
        <li>1/4 tsp white pepper </li>   
    </ul>
   Recipe Notes:
    <ol>
        <li>Vegetables – I used peas, corn, carrots frozen (no need to thaw), mushrooms, celery and capsicum. Use 2 cups of any vegetables you want. Dice firm vegetables like carrots. For leafy things like Asian greens, chop the stems into small bite size pieces, and chop the leaves into 2.5cm/1″ pieces (they will wilt).</li>
        <li>Long grain white rice is best for Chinese fried rice. But any cooked, cold rice will be fine – white or brown.</li>
        <li>Cold, day old rice – You need day old rice that’s been refrigerated or frozen (then thawed).The rice grains dry out, making them ideal for fried rice. </li>
        <li>I do find day old rice inconvenient, so I often just cook rice and us it straight away as long as you do not over cook the rice.Sticky freshly cooked rice is no good for fried rice – it makes fried rice gluey. </li>
        <li>Protein - Any protein that you have left over works well, cooked or fresh</li>
    </ol>
