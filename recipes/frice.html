                <h2>Fried Rice and how to make it as good as a chinese restaurant.</h2>
                
                <p> Get the sauce right and you can make a fried rice that really stacks up to your favourite 
                    Chinese restaurant in 10 minutes! This fried rice recipe is super quick, made with egg, 
                    veggies and a handful of bacon. But it’s totally customisable – make it your own! </p>
    
                <p>This is a quick, 15 minute, fried rice recipe that’s highly versatile. Terrific as it is, but totally adaptable to add what you want.
                I’ve used egg and a basic mix of frozen chopped vegetables – because I totally buy into the whole “snap frozen” thing 
                and this is intended to be super quick ‘n easy. Just carrots, peas and corn (still frozen, don’t even need to thaw).</p>
