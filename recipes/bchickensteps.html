         <h1>Marinade</h1>  
            <div class="recipe-content">
            <section class="recipe-info">
                <p>Let the chicken rest in the marinade for a minimum of 12 hours in the refrigerator. The longer you leave the more tender and juicer the chicken is going to be. You can leave this for a maximum of 48 hours.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make sure there is no excess moisture on your chicken. Pat dry with kitchen tissues/paper,
                    if required. 
                    <li>Add red chili powder, salt and lemon juice. Mix well, cover and rest for 20 mins. 
                    This step seasons your chicken well and this is always followed by the Indian restaurant chefs. 
                    <p>(But if you don’t care, you may marinate everything at one shot using all the marinade 
                    ingredients at once.)</p></li>
                    <li>Later add ginger garlic paste, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, kasuri methi, 
                    turmeric and hung curd/ Greek yogurt. Mix well and cover and place inm the refrigerator. </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Prepare the sauce/gravy</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The use onions is optional but helps to cut down the sour taste of the tomatoes, especially if you are using canned tomatoes or passata. Heat 1 to 2 tbsp oil in a pan and add 1½ cups (130 grams) sliced onions (1 medium yellow onion) and saute on a medium heat until slightly golden, for 7 to 8 minutes. You don’t need to brown them. Cool down slightly and add to the blender.</li>
                    <li>To the same blender jar add tomatoes – you can either use 600 grams, diced fresh tomatoes or 1 cup passata/ canned tomato puree or ⅓ cup double concentrate tomato paste or 1 440g can whole peeled tomatoes.
                        Also add 28 whole cashews (42 grams) – (or omit nuts to substitute with ¼ to ⅓ heavy cream later at the end)
                        pour half cup water to the blender. Grind to a smooth puree. Alternately, If you do not have a powerful blender, you may soak the cashews in ½ cup hot water for 30 mins and then puree them separately in a small coffee grinder like the way I did.
                        puree tomatoes and cashews</li>
                    <li>To make the cashew cream, I grind the cashews first to a powder and then add ¼ cup water and grind again. Pour another ¼ cup water and grind again. Puree them very smooth.
                        I leave the pureeing part for you to decide. Choose the method that works for you, depending on the kind of grinder/blender you own – together or separately but smoother the better.
                        pureed tomatoes with cashews</li>
                    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a pan. Add the optional whole spices – cinnamon, cloves and cardamoms. Once they begin to sizzle, add ginger garlic paste, green chilies (leave out for kids) and fry on a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes till the raw smell goes away.
                        temper spices for butter chicken sauce</li> 
                    <li>Saute ginger garlic. Do not burn.</li>
                    <li>Turn off the heat. Stir in the red chilli powder, garam masala, cumin powder and coriander powder.
                        stir in the spices</li>
                    <li>Strain the tomatoes. If your puree is not smooth strain it to the pan. Pass tomato puree through strainer, use a sturdy spoon to strain and discard the residue.</li>
                    <li>Mix well and bring this to a boil on a medium high heat. Be careful as this can easily splatter. Simmer tomatoes</li>
                    <li>Cover partially and let boil on a medium heat, stirring often, until thick. This takes about 12 to 15 mins, depending on the kind of cookware and stove.</li>
                    <li>At this stage stir in the cashew cream or puree if you made it separately. (If you are substituting cashews with heavy cream, wait till the end to include it. Do not add here)</li>
                    <li>Add 1½ cups hot water and mix well. (If you are not using cashews, cut down to 1 cup)</li>
                <li>Simmer this, partially covered for 10 mins or until the sauce thickens & traces of fats/butter are visible on top of the sauce. The sauce is now ready</li>
                </ol>

            <h1>Assembly</h1>
                <div class="recipe-content">
                      <p>For assembling, you need:</p>
                        <ol >
                            <li>Cook the chicken. Make sure your chicken is not too cold. Grill the chicken on the stove top or Bake in the oven
                                <ol type="A">  
                                    <li> To use oven, preheat the oven to 240C or 460F for at least 15 minutes. Skew the chicken on to soaked wooden skewers or place on a greased tray and bake for 20 to 22 minutes, depending on the size of chicken pieces. In between you will have to turn to the other side.</li>
                        
                                    <li> To pan-fry/grill chicken on griddle/tawa. Add one tablespoon oil/butter or ghee and place the chicken pieces spacing them apart. Fry on a medium heat for 2 mins. Ignore the moisture oozing out of the chicken. Turn the chicken pieces to the other side, don’t burn and do not overcook.
                                </ol> </li>
                        
                            <li>Cook till the chicken is just done and all the moisture evaporates. Optional – If you want browned chicken, increase the flame to high and roast until they turn golden or light brown on both the sides. Be careful as this can easily burn the masala & dry out your chicken. This way roast the chicken pieces in 2 to 3 batches, depending on the size of your skillet. Avoid browning in a non-stick pan   grilled chicken</li>
                        
                            <li>Add chicken to the butter chicken gravy.</li>
                    
                            <li>Pour ½ cup more hot water if the sauce is too thick and simmer for about 5 to 7 minutes till it becomes tender. This is the time the sauce actually develops the flavors. The cook time may vary here. This additional half cup water is not mentioned in the recipe and is optional depending on how long you cook. But I always add it.</li>
                            <li>Add ½ to ¾ teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar and ½ tablespoon kasuri methi. Stir well and taste test. If required add more garam masala & another tablespoon butter for additional flavor.</li>
                            <li>Stir in ¼ to ⅓ cup heavy cream. (If you have not used cashews, you will use ½ to 2/3 cup in total).
                            Or you can also temper the cream to prevent splitting. Take a few tablespoons of the hot gravy to a small bowl and stir in the cream. Mix and then pour the cream to the butter chicken. This prevents cream from splitting.</li>
                        </ol>
